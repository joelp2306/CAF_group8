# CAF Group 8

This project presents an analysis of identifying optimal locations and times for the re-use of braking technology as well as detecting trains with anomalous energy consumption for CAF Digital Services’ - Euskotren operations from April 2022 to April 2024 in the north of Spain. 

These are the challenges specified by CAF that we tackled as part of our project, focusing on improving efficiency and sustainability in train operations.

### Re-use braking energy:

* Which geographical locations are most likely to reuse braking energy?
* Are there times when there is a greater opportunity to re-use the braking energy?

### Reduce out-of-service energy:

* Which equipment/trains have an "anomalous" consumption?

### Methodology
To tackle these challenges, we used a combination of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. The code and analysis used to address these objectives are available in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks.
